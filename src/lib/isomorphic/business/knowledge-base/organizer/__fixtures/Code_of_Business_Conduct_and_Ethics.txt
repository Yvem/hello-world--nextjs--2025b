Code of
 
Business
 
Conduct &
 
Ethics


Atl˜ssi˜n™s mission is to unle˜sh the potenti˜l of 
every te˜m, ˜nd we must ˜ct with inte˚rity to ˜chieve 
it. E˜ch of us is responsible for beh˜vin˚ ethic˜lly, 
honestly, ˜nd respectfully. E˜ch of us h˜s ˜ p˜rt to pl˜y 
Œ  our employees, directors, officers, ˜˚ents, p˜rtners, 
represent˜tives, contr˜ctors, ˜nd consult˜nts.
Our unique values describe what we stand for at the most 
fundamental level. They shape our culture and influence who we are, 
what we do, and even who we hire. They™re hard-wired into our DNA 
and will stay the same as we continue to grow.
Our values are reflected in the Atlassian Code of Business Conductand  
E thics. The Code guides our actions across every p a r t  of  t h e  c o m p a n y,  
from our Board of Directors to our interns.
In addition to Atlassian™s policies and practices, the Code addresses  
how to properly interact with people and organizations. We are all  
responsible for holding our contractors, consultants, par tners, suppliers, 
and every Atlassian to the standards in our Code. Our future success  
depends on following these principles and taking them seriously.  
Without them, we risk creating significant liability for Atlassian and 
even threatening our ability to do business.
So please ensure you familiarize yourselves with the Code and 
remember that we expect you to know and comply with the legal 
requirements relating to your job and the services you are providing 
to Atlassian. We trust and expect you to use common sense and the 
highest ethical standards when making business decisions Œ even 
when there is no stated guideline.
Above all, we should always focus on doing the right thing. We all 
have a role to play.

with our community, customers, and partners.  We will not tolerate discrimination against or 
harassment of employees, consultants, contractors, or customers based on any characteristic 
protected by law, such as age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, national

Drugs, Controlled Substances, & Alcohol 
Being under the influence of a drug or alcohol while on company premises or while conducting 
company business may interfere with a safe and healthy work environment and may pose 
serious risks to the user and to those around them. 
We expect you to act responsibly when it comes to consuming alcohol. You represent Atlassian  
Œ whether in the office, at an after-hours work activity, an offsite, or Atlassian-sponsored event. 
Never drink to the point of impairment or in a way that may lead to inappropriate behavior or 
endanger the safety of others. Regardless, always follow the local laws of your location.
Atlassian has a zero-tolerance policy against illegal drugs. Employees are not allowed to 
possess, trade, or use illegal drugs or report to work under the influence of illegal drugs. 
Please read Atlassian™s 
Policy Œ Alcohol and Drug Use

Weapons & Violence
Atlassian is committed to a violence-free work environment. We do not tolerate any level of 
violence or the threat of violence in the workplace. Under no circumstances should you bring

conducted. In case of potential violence or danger, immediately contact local law enforcement 
and report it to your manager and your local 
HR People Par tner

.
Free & Fair Competition 
Competing vigorously, yet lawfully, with competitors and establishing advantageous, but fair, 
business relationships with customers and suppliers is a par t of the foundation for Atlassian™s 
long-term success. On the other hand, unlawful and unethical conduct, which may lead to 
shor t-term gains, may damage Atlassian™s reputation and long-term business prospects. 
You must deal ethically and lawfully with the company™s customers, suppliers, competitors, 
and employees in all business dealings on the company™s behalf. You should not take unfair 
advantage of another person through the abuse of privileged or confidential information or 
through improper manipulation, concealment, or misrepresentation of material facts.
No Insider Trading 
If you learn of any material nonpublic information about Atlassian or a company with which 
Atlassian does business (for example, a customer, supplier, or other parties with which 
Atlassian is negotiating a major transaction, such as an acquisition, investment, or sale), you 
may not trade in Atlassian™s securities or that other party™s securities until the information 
becomes public or is no longer material.
In simple terms, material nonpublic information is any type of information that could 
reasonably be expected to affect the market price of Atlassian™s securities or a third par ty™s 
securities, as the case may be, that has not been disseminated in a manner making it 
available to investors generally. Trading stock or encouraging others to trade stock on the 
basis of material nonpublic information, regardless of how small or large the trade, may 
constitute insider trading, insider dealing, or stock tipping and constitute a criminal offense
 
in most countries where we do business. 
Like many public companies, Atlassian has adopted specific trading restrictions to guard 
against insider trading. Do not confuse these trading restrictions with the broader prohibition 
on trading when in possession of material nonpublic information. In other words, the 
company™s ﬁtrading windowﬂ may be open but you may nonetheless be in possession of 
material nonpublic information that makes it inappropriate to trade. For more information, 
please read

Anti-Bribery 
We are committed to complying with all anti-bribery laws, 
including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA) and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Any form of 
bribery, direct or indirect, is strictly prohibited. That means 
you must not offer a bribe to, or accept one from, any 
person, at any time, for any reason. Any third party, supplier, 
contractor, consultant, agent, or intermediary acting on 
Atlassian™s behalf is also prohibited from offering, giving, or 
accepting bribes. You have a continuing and independent 
obligation to ensure compliance with these laws and 
Atlassian™s 
Policy Œ U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and 
Anti-Corruption
.
Cultural ﬁnormsﬂ are never an excuse
 
to make a bribe.
Failure to comply with the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and other  
similar anti-corruption laws may result in civil and/or criminal  
fines and penalties to Atlassian, as well as significant harm to  
the company™s reputation. It may also result in civil and criminal  
penalties being imposed against any company personnel, 
agents, and business partners involved. Your non-compliance 
with the 
Policy Œ U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Anti-
Corruption
 will result in disciplinary action being taken, up to 
and including termination of employment or services.

Dealing with Public or Government Officials
When Atlassian does business with any government entity, state-owned enterprise, or 
public international organization on a country, state, or local level, we must abide by all 
applicable laws and regulations related to these types of transactions. In dealing with public 
sector customers in the United States or other countries, you are required to understand 
the special rules that may apply. Please read 
Policy Œ U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and 
Anti-Corruption

rule (the approval of which will be rare), please see the Compliance Officer (Atlassian has 
designated its Deputy General Counsel - Corporate as its Compliance Officer for the purposes 
of this Code). 
Never provide a gift, including meals, enter tainment, or other 
items of value, to a government official.
Customers, Par tners, & Suppliers 
We expect that our customers, par tners, suppliers, and other third parties (we call them 
ﬁbusiness partnersﬂ in this section) will comply with all laws and act ethically in all respects. 
In light of that, when you engage any business partners, consider how they align with our 
values and conduct their businesses.

Many business partners will represent Atlassian and may be a customer™s or the public™s only 
interaction with Atlassian. When engaging a business partner, only select those parties who

references by local agents to ﬁspecial accommodationsﬂ that have to be made with local 
officials or statements that you should not ask too many questions about how business

requests for ﬁup frontﬂ payments when such payments are not expressly required by a 
written business agreement
 
·
requests for payment to an offshore bank account, in cash, in a different name, to a shell 
corporation, to an account in a different country, through private payment procedures, or to 
an unrelated third party
 
·
refusal by a prospective agent to commit to comply with Atlassian™s compliance policies

Atlassian recognizes and respects that you have responsibilities and interests outside of 
wo r k .  However, it is your responsibility to avoid situations where a conflict of interest could 
occur with respect to your obligations to Atlassian. 
Gener˜lly, ˜ conflict of interest exists when ˜ person˜l 
interest or ˜ctivity inter feres with your profession˜l 
jud˚ment or your responsibilities to Atl˜ssi˜n.
Transparency is key. Even the appearance of a conflict of interest can be damaging and 
harmful to Atlassian and your reputation. Such a conflict may arise directly, or indirectly, as 
a result of the personal interests or activities of a family member (or significant other) or 
organization with which you are affiliated. 
If you think you mi˚ht be f˜ced with ˜ conflict of 
interest, it is import˜nt to ˜ddress the situ˜tion 
immedi˜tely. T˜lk to your m˜n˜˚er or the Compli˜nce 
Officer, immedi˜tely ce˜se the ˜ctivity until you 
confirm whether ˜ conflict exists, ˜nd remove yourself 
from ˜ny decision-m˜kin˚ responsibilities th˜t ˜re 
rel˜ted to the conflict.
Any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of 
interest should be reported promptly to the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer may 
notify the Board of Directors or its Audit Committee as they deem appropriate. 
Members of the Board of Directors should disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest 
in accordance with 
Atlassian™s Policy Œ Related Person Transactions
 (which applies only to 
the Board of Directors) and, if necessary, seek the appropriate authorization for the conflict 
situation. Actual or potential conflicts of interest involving an executive officer other than the 
Compliance Officer should be disclosed directly to the Compliance Officer. Actual or potential 
conflicts of interest involving the Compliance Officer should be disclosed directly to the Chief 
Financial Officer.

Outside Employment & Other Affiliations 
We are proud of Atlassians™ innovative spirit and curiosity  
and recognize it™s what makes you a great par t of Atlassian.  
However, employees may not work at another company as an  
employee, independent contractor, or consultant, or serve on  
its board of directors, where the affiliation gives or appears  
to give rise to a conflict of interest or interferes with your  
ability to perform services for Atlassian. For example, you are  
prohibited from simultaneous employment with a competitor  
of Atlassian or from participating in any activity that enhances  
or suppor ts a competitor™s position. If you are unsure if your 
outside work or affiliation with an outside interest could  
create or appear to create a conflict of interest, please review  
Atlassian™s 
Global Œ Guidelines for Outside Activities
.
Serving on a Board of Directors
In general, Atlassian employees are prohibited from serving on  
the board of directors of competitors but may be permitted to  
serve as a board member of other entities, including non-profit  
organizations. If you are considering serving on a board of  
directors, discuss it with your manager, read Atlassian™s 
Global  
Œ Guidelines for Outside Activities
, and follow the Guidelines™  
instructions for requesting approval.
WHERE CAN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARISE?
Some examples include:
 
·
Competing with Atlassian by working for 
 
a competitor
 
·
Accepting gifts from (or offering gifts to) 
customers, suppliers, partners, government 
representatives, or public organizations
 
·
Personally benefiting from Atlassian™s property
 
or information or your position at Atlassian

or mi˚ht result in person˜l benefit bec˜use of your role 
˜t Atl˜ssi˜n. Fin˜nci˜l interests include investment, 
ownership, or creditor interests. 
Many factors may be considered in determining whether a conflict situation exists, including 
the size and nature of the investment, your ability to influence Atlassian decisions or decisions 
by third parties affecting Atlassian, your access to Atlassian confidential information or of the 
other company, and the nature of the relationship between Atlassian and the other company.
Personal Benefit or Gain from Business 
Conflicts of interest m˜y ˜lso occur when you or ˜n 
immedi˜te f˜mily member receive some person˜l 
benefit in connection with ˜ny tr˜ns˜ction involvin˚ 
Atl˜ssi˜n or ˜s ˜ result of your position ˜t Atl˜ssi˜n. 
There are limited exceptions to this rule described in the 
Gifts and Enter tainment
 section 
below. In addition, you must disclose to the Compliance Officer all situations where you may 
be conducting Atlassian business with members of your family, your friends, or others with 
whom you have a close personal relationship.
Corporate Oppor tunities
You should not knowingly pursue or par ticipate in a business opportunity where Atlassian
 
has an interest or which is closely related to Atlassian™s current business or its anticipated future 
plans. If you believe you may be pursuing such an oppor tunity, disclose it to the Compliance Officer.

Political Contributions
Business contributions to political campaigns are strictly regulated by federal, state, provincial,  
and local law in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other jurisdictions where  
Atlassian operates. Accordingly, all political contributions proposed to be made with Atlassian™s  
funds or on Atlassian™s behalf must be coordinated through and approved by the Compliance 
Officer, and in cer tain cases may require prior shareholder approval under the United Kingdom  
Companies Act 2006. You may not, without the approval of the Compliance Officer, use any of  
Atlassian™s funds for political contributions of any kind to any political candidate or holder of  
any national, state, provincial, or local government office. You may make personal contributions  
but should not represent that you are making any such contribution at Atlassian™s request or on  
Atlassian™s behalf. Similar restrictions on political contributions may apply in other countries.  
Specific questions should be directed to the Compliance Officer.
Gifts & Enter tainment When Dealing with Non-Governmental or Non-Public Third Par ties  
Atl˜ssi˜n expects th˜t you will use ˚ood jud˚ment, 
discretion, ˜nd moder˜tion when ˚ivin˚ or ˜cceptin˚ 
˚ifts or enter t˜inment in business settin˚s. 
Employees of, and third par ties representing, Atlassian should not request, accept, offer to give,  
or give anything of significant value that would give the appearance of impropriety or suggest 
that it was intended in any way to influence a business relationship. Gifts in the form of cash  
payments are not allowed, regardless of amount. Please see 
Policy - Procurement
 for up to date  
information on what is considered appropriate amounts for gifts and enter tainment.  
Any gifts and enter tainment involving government or government-related individuals must be 
in compliance with the law in that country and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA). For further information, please see the
 
Dealing with Public or Government Employees
 
section in this Code.
Side Deals & Side Letters
All the terms and conditions of agreements entered into by Atlassian must be formally 
documented. Contract terms and conditions define the key attributes of Atlassian™s rights,  
obligations, and liabilities, and can also dictate the accounting treatment given to a transaction.  
Making (or agreeing to make in the future) business commitments outside of the formal  
contracting process, through side deals, side letters, or otherwise, is unacceptable. You should  
not make any oral or written commitments that create a new agreement or modify or propose  
to modify an existing agreement without approval through the formal contracting process.

this commitment usin˚ ˜ppro˜ches b˜sed on the UN 
Guidin˚ Principles on Business ˜nd Hum˜n Ri˚hts.
Planet Œ a Net-Zero Future
Climate change is caused by humans, and without immediate intervention, it will fundamentally  
disrupt the environment, society, and the economy in very painful ways. Working together, the  
private sector, public sector, and citizens must play as a team and take bold action. As par t of  
our commitment to combat climate change, Atlassian will run our operations on 100 percent  
renewable energy by 2025. We™re also setting science-based targets to limit warming to 1.5°C and  
achieve net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. Finally, we are focusing on inspiring Atlassians  
and companies alike to act.
Community Œ a New Approach to Corporate Philanthropy
Long before we had a stock ticker symbol Œ and even before we™d adopted our company 
values Œ co-founders Mike and Scott built giving back into Atlassian™s operations, with a belief 
that both business and education can serve as forces for good and help transform our world. 
Through the Atlassian Foundation, we contribute 1% of our profits, employee time, equity, and 
products to social-impact organizations. Atlassian™s contributions have a positive impact in 
our local communities and in far-flung regions across the globe.

Customers Œ Leading with Security & Respecting Privacy
We believe privacy is a fundamental human right, which means we design our products with 
security and privacy in mind. This belief also means we must earn and keep our customers™ 
trust; to do that, we strive to be transparent about how we collect, use, and share information. 
We are open about the privacy and security options available to our customers and our own 
practices. We publish a regular

access customer information (where permitted), including whether and how we complied. 
People Œ Unleashing the Potential of Our Team 
Atlassian is for everyone, and integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion across everything we 
do will help drive the structural shifts needed to unleash the potential of our teams. These two  
principles, along with our values, define how we build our people programs and work spaces.  
We know that teams with diverse perspectives per form better, so we invest in creating teams  
with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences, and skills, and a strong sense of belonging. And

Managing & Retaining Business Records 
The integrity, reliability, and accuracy in all material respects of Atlassian™s books, records, and 
financial statements are fundamental to its continued and future business success. You may 
not cause Atlassian to enter into a transaction with the intent to document or record such 
transaction in a deceptive or unlawful manner. In addition, you may not create any false or 
ar tificial documentation or book entry for any transaction entered into by Atlassian. Similarly, 
officers, employees, consultants, contractors, and others working on behalf of the company 
who have responsibility for accounting and financial repor ting matters have a responsibility to 
accurately record all funds, assets, and transactions on Atlassian™s books and records.
It is equally important to know when to save information and when to periodically dispose of 
documents that are no longer useful or do not need to be retained. If litigation is pending or 
threatened, you must retain all per tinent documents in accordance with instructions received 
from the Legal team. Local laws regarding record retention and disposal may vary. 
Quality of Public Disclosures
Atlassian is committed to providing its shareholders with information about its financial 
condition and results of operations as required by the securities laws of the United States. 
It is Atlassian™s policy to provide fair, timely, and understandable disclosures in the reports 
and documents that it submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other 
authorities. Officers, employees, consultants, contractors, and others working on behalf of the 
company who are responsible for these filings and disclosures, including Atlassian™s principal 
executive, financial, and accounting officers, must use reasonable judgment and perform 
their responsibilities honestly, ethically, and objectively in order to ensure that this disclosure 
policy is fulfilled. Members of Atlassian™s Disclosure Committee are primarily responsible for 
monitoring the company™s public disclosures.

Atlassian is subject to global trade controls, including United States expor t controls and 
economic sanctions regulations and laws regulating international transactions. In addition, 
United States law prohibits Atlassian from participating in foreign boycotts and unsanctioned 
embargoes (in other words, embargoes that are not supported by the United States). It is 
Atlassian™s policy, as outlined in its 
Policy - Expor t Controls Compliance
, to comply with these 
laws and regulations even if it may result in the loss of some business opportunities. You are 
responsible for being familiar with the basic elements of these laws and to comply with them 
at all times. You should learn and understand the extent to which Australian, United Kingdom, 
United States, and international trade controls apply to transactions conducted by Atlassian. 
Violation of these laws can lead to severe penalties, even for unintentional violations. 
Export Controls
Generally, an export can include the sharing of any product or technology (including hardware, 
software, or source code), which is located within, created within, or traveling through a 
country and then sent, disclosed, made available for download, or otherwise transferred 
beyond the country™s borders or to a foreign country or customer via shipping, electronic or 
digital transmission, verbal communication, or other means. Expor ts can also include ﬁdeemed 
expor ts,ﬂ which are sharing of source code or technology to foreign nationals, wherever 
located, even within your own country. Many countries maintain controls on the destinations 
to which, and individuals to whom, products, including software, may be exported, and certain 
products may require a license for Atlassian to export. 
The United St˜tes m˜int˜ins some of the strictest expor t 
controls in the world. United St˜tes l˜w forbids doin˚ 
business with cert˜in countries ˜nd their n˜tion˜ls 
without obt˜inin˚ prior United St˜tes ˚overnment˜l

Unsanctioned Embargoes & Anti-Boycott Rules
United States federal law prohibits Atlassian from par ticipating in any foreign boycott or 
embargo against countries, companies, or individuals that is not approved by the United 
States government. We must repor t any requests to participate in such unsanctioned boycotts 
or embargoes. Perhaps the most common unsanctioned boycott is the Arab League™s boycott 
of Israel. This might include a request to insert a contractual clause into an agreement 
that obligates a par ty to boycott any country, confirm that a product was not originated or 
developed in a country, or that prohibits doing business with, or traveling to, certain countries. 
WHAT COUNTRIES ARE CONSIDERED ﬁUNFRIENDLYﬂ COUNTRIES?
The United States government maintains a number of boycotts against countries 
considered unfriendly to United States interests. The prohibited countries list changes  
frequently due to world events and changes in United States foreign policy. Never  
assume that a country is not on the list. If you are unsure if you can transact business  
with a par ticular country, company, or individual, please contact Atlassian™s Legal team.

First Seek Guidance
The best star ting point for you to seek advice on ethics-related issues or repor ting potential 
violations of the Code will usually be your manager or supervisor. However, if the conduct in 
question involves your manager or supervisor, or if you believe your manager or supervisor has 
not dealt with the matter properly, or if you do not feel that you can discuss the matter with 
your manager or supervisor, you may raise it with the Compliance Officer.
Repor ting Ethics-Related Issues or Potential Violations of the Code.  
You may communicate with the Compliance Officer (Atlassian has designated its Deputy 
General Counsel - Corporate as its Compliance Officer for the purposes of this Code), or repor t 
potential ethics-related issues and violations of the Code, by any of the following methods 
(most of which may be done anonymously subject to local laws):
 
·
in writing by email to 
Compliance-Officer@atlassian.com 
(this option does not 
allow for anonymous repor ting)
 
·
Anonymously via the Atlassian Ethics and Compliance Por tal by:
Calling 1.800.461.9330 in the United States or 1.800.763.983 in Australia; for other 
locations, visit

Special Rules for Our Por tal Internationally. 
Please note that certain countries 
in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC where Atlassian does business may not allow 
cer tain concerns to be repor ted at all or to be reported anonymously via the

Repor ting Work-Related Grievances 
Atlassian™s 
Policy Œ Grievance
 sets out the appropriate channels for submitting matters concerning  
unfair treatment in an Atlassian work environment that causes undue concern, distress, or a  
feeling of injustice. Before reporting these types of matters via Atlassian™s E thics and Compliance

Policy Œ Grievance
.
Notes about Repor ting   
Anonymity. 
When repor ting suspected violations of the Code, Atlassian prefers that you 
identify yourself; this helps facilitate an effective and timely investigation and appropriate 
remedial action. However, Atlassian also recognizes that some people may feel more 
comfor table repor ting a suspected violation anonymously.
If you wish to remain anonymous, you may do so (to the extent allowed by local law), and 
Atlassian will use reasonable effor ts to protect your confidentiality subject to applicable 
law, rule, or regulation or any applicable legal proceedings. In the event the repor t is made 
anonymously, however, Atlassian may not have sufficient information to look into or otherwise 
investigate or evaluate the allegations. Accordingly, you should provide as much detail as is 
reasonably necessary to permit Atlassian to evaluate the matter(s) set for th in the anonymous 
report and, if appropriate, commence and conduct an appropriate investigation.
Cooperation. 
You are expected to cooperate with Atlassian in any investigation of a potential 
violation of the Code, any other Atlassian policy or practice, or any applicable law, rule, or 
regulation.
Misuse of Reporting Channels. 
You must not use these repor ting channels in bad faith, or to 
report false or frivolous grievances. Please use the Ethics and Compliance Por tal only to report 
grievances that involve the Code or other ethics-related issues.
Director Communications. 
A director on the Board of Directors may also communicate 
concerns or seek advice with respect to this Code by contacting the Board of Directors through 
its Chairperson or the Audit Committee.
